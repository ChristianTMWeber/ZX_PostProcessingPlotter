Reducible Data Driven backgrounds from H4l groups.

The histogram in 'allShapes.root' are normalized to 1fb^-1

'rehbrtest.log' contains normalization information

The files are taken from:
/eos/atlas/atlascerngroupdisk/phys-higgs/HSG2/H4l/2018/MiniTrees/Prod_v20Fix/backgroundResults/allShapes.root

And the code to produce these seems to live at 
https://gitlab.cern.ch/HZZ/HZZSoftware/HZZ4lBackground/
